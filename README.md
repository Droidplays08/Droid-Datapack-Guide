Want to know how to make your very own datapack? This is a series where I teach you how to make your own datapack, as well as providing coding template so you can follow along!

If you just want to simply download the datapack and try it out, you don't need to unzip it. But if you wish to edit and create a datapack with you own ideas, then unzip the folder before editing.
